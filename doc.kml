Locations on high ground (e.g. mountains and ridges etc.) will be easier to receive reception in comparison to more densely cluttered environments.

Locations on high ground (e.g. mountains and ridges etc.) will be easier to receive reception in comparison to more densely cluttered environments.

				<description><![CDATA[&lt;p align=justify&gt; Reception is dependent upon the receiving site and receiver sensitivity.  Locations on high ground (e.g. mountains and ridges etc.) will be easier to receive reception in comparison to more densely cluttered environments.  Reception would most likely be achieved under ordinary conditions with the use of a good quality external antenna and low noise amplifier if necessary. &lt;/p&gt;<center><table><tr><th colspan='2' align='center'><em></em></th></tr><tr bgcolor="#E3E3F3"> <th>Area</th> <td>Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area</td> </tr><tr bgcolor=""> <th>State</th> <td>NSW</td> </tr><tr bgcolor="#E3E3F3"> <th>Service</th> <td>FM Radio</td> </tr><tr bgcolor=""> <th>Frequency</th> <td>100.5 FM</td> </tr></table></center>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[&lt;p align=justify&gt; Reception is dependent upon the receiving site and receiver sensitivity.  Locations on high ground (e.g. mountains and ridges etc.) will be easier to receive reception in comparison to more densely cluttered environments.  Reception would most likely be achieved under ordinary conditions with the use of a good quality external antenna and low noise amplifier if necessary. &lt;/p&gt;<center><table><tr><th colspan='2' align='center'><em></em></th></tr><tr bgcolor="#E3E3F3"> <th>Area</th> <td>Port Stephens</td> </tr><tr bgcolor=""> <th>State</th> <td>NSW</td> </tr><tr bgcolor="#E3E3F3"> <th>Service</th> <td>FM Radio</td> </tr><tr bgcolor=""> <th>Frequency</th> <td>95.9 FM</td> </tr></table></center>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[&lt;p align=justify&gt; Reception is dependent upon the receiving site and receiver sensitivity.  Locations on high ground (e.g. mountains and ridges etc.) will be easier to receive reception in comparison to more densely cluttered environments.

Reception would most likely be achieved under ordinary conditions with the use of a good quality external antenna and low noise amplifier if necessary. &lt;/p&gt;<center><table><tr><th colspan='2' align='center'><em></em></th></tr><tr bgcolor="#E3E3F3"> <th>Area</th> <td>Newcastle Waters</td> </tr><tr bgcolor=""> <th>State</th> <td>NT</td> </tr><tr bgcolor="#E3E3F3"> <th>Service</th> <td>FM Radio</td> </tr><tr bgcolor=""> <th>Frequency</th> <td>106.1 FM</td> </tr></table></center>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[&lt;p align=justify&gt; Reception is dependent upon the receiving site and receiver sensitivity.  Locations on high ground (e.g. mountains and ridges etc.) will be easier to receive reception in comparison to more densely cluttered environments.  Reception would most likely be achieved under ordinary conditions with the use of a good quality external antenna and low noise amplifier if necessary. &lt;/p&gt;<center><table><tr><th colspan='2' align='center'><em></em></th></tr><tr bgcolor="#E3E3F3"> <th>Area</th> <td>Cairns</td> </tr><tr bgcolor=""> <th>State</th> <td>QLD</td> </tr><tr bgcolor="#E3E3F3"> <th>Service</th> <td>FM Radio</td> </tr><tr bgcolor=""> <th>Frequency</th> <td>106.7 FM</td> </tr></table></center>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[&lt;p align=justify&gt; Reception is dependent upon the receiving site and receiver sensitivity.  Locations on high ground (e.g. mountains and ridges etc.) will be easier to receive reception in comparison to more densely cluttered environments.  Reception would most likely be achieved under ordinary conditions with the use of a good quality external antenna and low noise amplifier if necessary. &lt;/p&gt;<center><table><tr><th colspan='2' align='center'><em></em></th></tr><tr bgcolor="#E3E3F3"> <th>Area</th> <td>Cairns (AM)</td> </tr><tr bgcolor=""> <th>State</th> <td>QLD</td> </tr><tr bgcolor="#E3E3F3"> <th>Service</th> <td>AM Radio</td> </tr><tr bgcolor=""> <th>Frequency</th> <td>801 AM</td> </tr></table></center>]]></description>

Reception would most likely be achieved under ordinary conditions with the use of a good quality external antenna and low noise amplifier if necessary. &lt;/p&gt;<center><table><tr><th colspan='2' align='center'><em></em></th></tr><tr bgcolor="#E3E3F3"> <th>Area</th> <td>Eidsvold</td> </tr><tr bgcolor=""> <th>State</th> <td>QLD</td> </tr><tr bgcolor="#E3E3F3"> <th>Service</th> <td>AM Radio</td> </tr><tr bgcolor=""> <th>Frequency</th> <td>855 AM</td> </tr></table></center>]]></description>

Locations on high ground (e.g. mountains and ridges etc.) will be easier to receive reception in comparison to more densely cluttered environments.  Reception would most likely be achieved under ordinary conditions with the use of a good quality external antenna and low noise amplifier if necessary. &lt;/p&gt;<center><table><tr><th colspan='2' align='center'><em></em></th></tr><tr bgcolor="#E3E3F3"> <th>Area</th> <td>Laura</td> </tr><tr bgcolor=""> <th>State</th> <td>QLD</td> </tr><tr bgcolor="#E3E3F3"> <th>Service</th> <td>FM Radio</td> </tr><tr bgcolor=""> <th>Frequency</th> <td>106.1 FM</td> </tr></table></center>]]></description>

Locations on high ground (e.g. mountains and ridges etc.) will be easier to receive reception in comparison to more densely cluttered environments.

				<description><![CDATA[&lt;p align=justify&gt; Reception is dependent upon the receiving site and receiver sensitivity.  Locations on high ground (e.g. mountains and ridges etc.) will be easier to receive reception in comparison to more densely cluttered environments.  Reception would most likely be achieved under ordinary conditions with the use of a good quality external antenna and low noise amplifier if necessary. &lt;/p&gt;<center><table><tr><th colspan='2' align='center'><em></em></th></tr><tr bgcolor="#E3E3F3"> <th>Area</th> <td>Pialba-Dundowran (Wide Bay)</td> </tr><tr bgcolor=""> <th>State</th> <td>QLD</td> </tr><tr bgcolor="#E3E3F3"> <th>Service</th> <td>AM Radio</td> </tr><tr bgcolor=""> <th>Frequency</th> <td>855 AM</td> </tr></table></center>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[&lt;p align=justify&gt; Reception is dependent upon the receiving site and receiver sensitivity.  Locations on high ground (e.g. mountains and ridges etc.) will be easier to receive reception in comparison to more densely cluttered environments.  Reception would most likely be achieved under ordinary conditions with the use of a good quality external antenna and low noise amplifier if necessary. &lt;/p&gt;<center><table><tr><th colspan='2' align='center'><em></em></th></tr><tr bgcolor="#E3E3F3"> <th>Area</th> <td>Tully</td> </tr><tr bgcolor=""> <th>State</th> <td>QLD</td> </tr><tr bgcolor="#E3E3F3"> <th>Service</th> <td>FM Radio</td> </tr><tr bgcolor=""> <th>Frequency</th> <td>95.5 FM</td> </tr></table></center>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[&lt;p align=justify&gt; Reception is dependent upon the receiving site and receiver sensitivity.  Locations on high ground (e.g. mountains and ridges etc.) will be easier to receive reception in comparison to more densely cluttered environments.

				<description><![CDATA[&lt;p align=justify&gt; Reception is dependent upon the receiving site and receiver sensitivity.  Locations on high ground (e.g. mountains and ridges etc.) will be easier to receive reception in comparison to more densely cluttered environments.  Reception would most likely be achieved under ordinary conditions with the use of a good quality external antenna and low noise amplifier if necessary. &lt;/p&gt;<center><table><tr><th colspan='2' align='center'><em></em></th></tr><tr bgcolor="#E3E3F3"> <th>Area</th> <td>Coober Pedy</td> </tr><tr bgcolor=""> <th>State</th> <td>SA</td> </tr><tr bgcolor="#E3E3F3"> <th>Service</th> <td>FM Radio</td> </tr><tr bgcolor=""> <th>Frequency</th> <td>106.1 FM</td> </tr></table></center>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[&lt;p align=justify&gt; Reception is dependent upon the receiving site and receiver sensitivity.  Locations on high ground (e.g. mountains and ridges etc.) will be easier to receive reception in comparison to more densely cluttered environments.

Locations on high ground (e.g. mountains and ridges etc.) will be easier to receive reception in comparison to more densely cluttered environments.

				<description><![CDATA[&lt;p align=justify&gt; Reception is dependent upon the receiving site and receiver sensitivity.  Locations on high ground (e.g. mountains and ridges etc.) will be easier to receive reception in comparison to more densely cluttered environments.  Reception would most likely be achieved under ordinary conditions with the use of a good quality external antenna and low noise amplifier if necessary. &lt;/p&gt;<center><table><tr><th colspan='2' align='center'><em></em></th></tr><tr bgcolor="#E3E3F3"> <th>Area</th> <td>Alexandra</td> </tr><tr bgcolor=""> <th>State</th> <td>VIC</td> </tr><tr bgcolor="#E3E3F3"> <th>Service</th> <td>FM Radio</td> </tr><tr bgcolor=""> <th>Frequency</th> <td>102.9 FM</td> </tr></table></center>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[&lt;p align=justify&gt; Reception is dependent upon the receiving site and receiver sensitivity.  Locations on high ground (e.g. mountains and ridges etc.) will be easier to receive reception in comparison to more densely cluttered environments.

				<description><![CDATA[&lt;p align=justify&gt; Reception is dependent upon the receiving site and receiver sensitivity.  Locations on high ground (e.g. mountains and ridges etc.) will be easier to receive reception in comparison to more densely cluttered environments.  Reception would most likely be achieved under ordinary conditions with the use of a good quality external antenna and low noise amplifier if necessary. &lt;/p&gt;<center><table><tr><th colspan='2' align='center'><em></em></th></tr><tr bgcolor="#E3E3F3"> <th>Area</th> <td>Eildon</td> </tr><tr bgcolor=""> <th>State</th> <td>VIC</td> </tr><tr bgcolor="#E3E3F3"> <th>Service</th> <td>FM Radio</td> </tr><tr bgcolor=""> <th>Frequency</th> <td>98.1 FM</td> </tr></table></center>]]></description>

Reception would most likely be achieved under ordinary conditions with the use of a good quality external antenna and low noise amplifier if necessary. &lt;/p&gt;<center><table><tr><th colspan='2' align='center'><em></em></th></tr><tr bgcolor="#E3E3F3"> <th>Area</th> <td>Western Victoria</td> </tr><tr bgcolor=""> <th>State</th> <td>VIC</td> </tr><tr bgcolor="#E3E3F3"> <th>Service</th> <td>FM Radio</td> </tr><tr bgcolor=""> <th>Frequency</th> <td>94.1 FM</td> </tr></table></center>]]></description>
